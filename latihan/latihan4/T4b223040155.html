          The Major was originally scheduled to take place from May 11 to May
          24, 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Valve and ESL
          postponed the Major to November. Because Valve generally sponsors two
          Majors per year, the delayed Major was to have a US$2,000,000 prize
          pool, making it the largest prize pool in CS:GO Major history. In
          September 2020, Valve and ESL announced that the Major was canceled
          because of continued complications from the COVID-19 outbreak in
          Brazil. In January 2021, Valve announced that PGL Major Stockholm 2021
          would be the next Major instead.

          On September 15, 2021, ESL published the 2022 ESL Pro Tour Road Map,
          announcing its intention to host a major in Rio. On January 25, 2022,
          Dexerto reported that ESL was planning to host the second major of
          2022 in Rio de Janeiro. ESL announced the Intel Extreme Masters Rio
          Major 2022, on May 24, 2022.

          The defending Major Champions are FaZe Clan, who won their first major
          championship at PGL Major Antwerp 2022. They were eliminated in the
          Legends Stage after their loss to Bad News Eagles.
